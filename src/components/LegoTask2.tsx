            In this task we had to make the robot turn on and off using a touch sensor, and to avoid walls and obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor. In addition, it had to start by saying "Exercise 2" whenever it is turned on by the touch sensor, and "Exercise done" whenever it is turned off by the touch sensor. This exercise taught me how to use the input devices with the robot.
